### **2. Ingest and Transform Data (30–35%)**

The second section covers the processes involved in **data ingestion and transformation**, which are critical tasks for any data engineer. You’ll need to demonstrate expertise in using Microsoft Fabric tools to handle large data volumes and efficiently prepare data for analysis.

- **Data Ingestion**: Configuring and managing **data pipelines** using tools like **Azure Data Factory** for ingesting data from diverse sources (on-premises and cloud-based).
- **Data Transformation**: Applying transformations to raw data to turn it into a usable format using tools such as **Azure Synapse Analytics** and **Power Query**.
- **Data Validation and Cleansing**: Ensuring data accuracy and integrity by applying appropriate transformations to clean and validate data before further processing.

This section tests your ability to set up robust **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipelines and work with large datasets in a variety of formats.

### **3. Monitor and Optimize an Analytics Solution (30–35%)**

Once an analytics solution is implemented and data is ingested and transformed, it’s crucial to ensure that the solution is continuously monitored and optimized. This section focuses on ensuring the scalability and performance of deployed data solutions.

- **Monitoring Data Pipelines**: Using tools like **Azure Monitor** and **Log Analytics** to track and evaluate the performance of your data pipelines and ensure they are running efficiently.
- **Optimization**: Identifying bottlenecks in your data processing workflows and optimizing both **data pipelines** and the infrastructure used for processing and storage.
- **Data Security and Compliance Monitoring**: Implementing continuous monitoring strategies to track data security and ensure compliance with relevant regulations and policies.

Candidates must prove they can analyze performance, identify problems, and optimize the solution to ensure efficient data processing.

## **Difference Between DP-600 and DP-700 Exams**

While both the **DP-600** and **DP-700** exams are part of the **Microsoft certification track** for data professionals, they cater to different job roles and focus on distinct skill sets.

### **DP-600: Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst Exam**
